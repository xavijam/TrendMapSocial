TrendMap social accounts
========================

In a [CartoDB leapfrog ](http://blog.cartodb.com/TrendMap/) we decided to
create the "new Chrome tab" where visualize the most visited CartoDB map
of the moment. We refresh the info every 20 minutes checking which one is
trendy.

But nowadays this is not enough, map makers want to know that through social
networks, as in Twitter, Facebook,...etc. This idea comes from @iriberri,
thanks lady!
